# Kansei 

## Overview

Kansei is a simple 3d voxel game using my custom framework [Lux](https://github.com/nidheimr/lux).

It was written for educational purposes and is likely not very efficient.

## Building

This project uses CMake.

Assuming you have CMake and a C/C++ compiler, you can run the following commands inside the project directory:
1. `cmake -S . -B build`
2. `cmake --build build`

The library will be placed inside `./bin/`.
